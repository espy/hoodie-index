After you clone, please `$ npm install && bower install`.

Run with `$ grunt server`, this will open the site in your default browser (you may need to reload once). You'll have livereload enabled on all `html`, `scss` and `js` files in `src`;

`$ grunt build` should work but might need some cleanup.
